# MulticastDelegate
An elegant multicast delegate written in swift with Unit tests

Installation
============

#### Manual

Copy `MulticastDelegate.swift` to your project

#### CocoaPods
```ruby
	pod 'MulticastDelegateSwift'
```
#### Swift Package Manager
You can use [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) and specify a dependency in `Package.swift` by adding this:
```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/jonasman/MulticastDelegate.git", majorVersion: 2)
```

Usage
============
Import the module
```swift
	import MulticastDelegateSwift
```

1. Add to your class: `let multicastDelegate = MulticastDelegate<MyProtocol>()`
2. Other classes must add as a delegate: `service.delegate.addDelegate(self)`
3. When you need to notify your delegates: `multicastDelegate.invokeDelegates { delegate in delegate.done() }`

Alternative version:

1. Add to your class: `let multicastDelegate = MulticastDelegate<MyProtocol>()`
2. Other classes must add as a delegate: `service.delegate += self`
3. When you need to notify your delegates: `multicastDelegate |> { $0.done() }`


Example
===========
```swift
protocol ServiceDelegate {
	func serviceGotData()
}

class Service {
	
	var delegate = MulticastDelegate<ServiceDelegate>()
	
	func fetchData() -> Bool {
		// fetch Data and notify your delegates
		// Call your delegates 
		delegate |> { delegate in
			delegate.serviceGotData()
		}
		return true
	}
}
```    
```swift
class MainViewController: UIViewController, TestDelegate {
	
	func serviceGotData() {
	    	// do nothing
	}
}
```
```swift
let service = Service()
let viewController = MainViewController()
		
service.delegate += viewController
		
service.fetchData()
```    

Operators
============
There are 3 operators to simplify the multicast usage

`+=` calls addDelegate(delegate: T)

`-=` calls removeDelegate(delegate: T)

`|>` calls invokeDelegates(invocation: (T) -> ())


Considerations
============
The code is based on HashTable with weak objects, so you don't need to worry when a delegate is deallocated
